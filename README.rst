Overwrite allure history id with testcase full name and testcase id if testcase has id, exclude parameters.

----

When the library is not installed,the ``historyId`` of the test cases generated by ``Allure`` is based on dynamic parameters within the test case, and each execution is not considered the same test case. After installing the library, when a test case id is configured, even with dynamic parameters, it will be recognized as the same test case.
